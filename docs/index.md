## About

**LogOnce** is a one-stop logistics tracker app for clerks to monitor shipping statuses of all clients and perform common logistics operations. It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, LogOnce can get your tracking tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
